For a few day I've been feeling very sleepy all day because of my fucked up sleeping schedule. Trying to fix it. I think I am more productive during late night upto 2 AM and in the late morning. So now I trying to sleep at max 3AM and wake up around 11AM. Let's hope it'll fix my sleeping schedule.

BTW this page looks like better way to write microblog than twitter. Although RN it's just a single markdown page, I'm thinking to make a folder and render that into a single page.

And a script to generate microblog post for that day, example. But I'm gonna try the current format out and see how it goes.

```bash
./microblog create
# And for just posting a small tweet.
./microblog post "Hello World"
```

Added microblog section on my site, the purpose of this page is to write micro, digestable information around anything I'm doing. I'll try to keep it updated as much as possible. It gonna be kinda like my twitter feed.
Sometimes, you'll find random shit in here too just like my tweets.
