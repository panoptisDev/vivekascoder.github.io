I am a blockchain developer. I worked at [Instaraise](https://instaraise.io) as a blockchain developer for a while. I love 🏗 building things, they're mostly toy projects. I was a part of [Tezos India Fellowship 2.0](https://tif2.devfolio.co/), [Antler India Fellowship](https://www.antler.co/india-fellowship) and most recently [Polygon India Fellowship](https://polygon.technology/polygon-fellowship/). Currently actively building on [Aptos](https://aptoslabs.com/) and [Sui](https://sui.io/).
