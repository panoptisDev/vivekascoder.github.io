## Intro
Coding editors is the place where we spent a majority of our time. It's important to have a good editor that can help you be more productive. I've been using VSCode for a while now and I've found some tips that can help you be more productive.

1. Remove the activity bar.
Type Command + Shift + P and search for `Toggle Activity Bar Visibility`. This will hide the activity bar on the left side of the editor. This will give you more space to work with.

2. Remappings
- Use Command + T to toggle the visibility of the terminal. This will help you to open the terminal faster.
- use Command + Ship + G to open git window on sidebar.
- use Command + Shift + X to open extension window.
- use Command + Shift + F to toggle search window on sidebar.

3. Use good font.
Use a better monospace font, for list of cool monospace fonts, checkout my lists page.

4. Use the symbol menu to navigate through the file.
Use Command + Shift + O to open the symbol menu. This will help you to navigate through the file faster.

5. Use Vim extension for Vim keybindings.
Install this extension for Vim keybindings. This will help you to navigate through the file faster.

6. Jump split editor.
Use Command + 1, Command + 2, Command + 3 to jump between split editors don't use mouse for that.


## Conclusion
Basically try to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible and stop relying on mouse. This will help you to be more productive.
