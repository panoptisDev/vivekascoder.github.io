## Intro
Coding editors is the place where we spent a majority of our time. It's important to have a good editor that can help you be more productive. I've been using VSCode for a while now and I've found some tips that can help you be more productive.

### Remove the activity bar.

Type Command + Shift + P and search for `Toggle Activity Bar Visibility`. This will hide the activity bar on the left side of the editor. This will give you more space to work with.

### Remappings

- Use Command + T to toggle the visibility of the terminal. This will help you to open the terminal faster.
- use Command + Ship + G to open git window on sidebar.
- use Command + Shift + X to open extension window.
- use Command + Shift + F to toggle search window on sidebar.

### Use good font.

Use a better monospace font, for list of cool monospace fonts, checkout my lists page.

### Use the symbol menu to navigate through the file.

Use Command + Shift + O to open the symbol menu. This will help you to navigate through the file faster.

### Use Vim extension for Vim keybindings.

Install this extension for Vim keybindings. This will help you to navigate through the file faster.

### Jump split editor.

Use Command + 1, Command + 2, Command + 3 to jump between split editors don't use mouse for that.

Also use Command + 0 to to back and forth between the activity window.

### Use Github Copilot.
Github Copilot is an AI code completion tool that really helps you to write repetetive code. It's a good tool to have as a programmer, it costs aroung 10$/month.


## Conclusion
Basically try to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible and stop relying on mouse. This will help you to be more productive.
